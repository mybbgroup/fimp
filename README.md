# FIMP
**Fancy Inline Moderation Popup**
Author: **effone** (effone@mybb.com)

No, its not a plugin, but an addon script for MyBB forum software to modernize the "Inline Moderation Tool".

**Installation**
As said; its not a MyBB plugin, hence you don't need to activate anything from ACP.
Only upload the `dist` content in `jscripts` folder, add following 2 resources in `showthread` and `forumdisplay` template. Rest all will be taken care by the script.
